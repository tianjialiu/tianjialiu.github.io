I used Jonathan McGlone's [blog post](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) on 'Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub' for the bare bones of my Github-hosted website. Previously, I've used Wordpress and Squarespace, but the cost of website hosting is high (e.g. $12/month for Squarespace) and honestly not worth the steep price. With Github Pages, it's free, and you just need to pay for a custom domain name. [Squarespace Domains](domains.squarespace.com) is $20/year and easy-to-use (previously Google Domains).

I started with the minimal HTML/CSS code required and didn't choose a fancy template like Bootstrap or HTML5. I liked the process of designing my own website (e.g. choosing fonts) and learning web development basics. Over the years, I've sporadically added various features that I thought looked cool on other people's research websites:

* Favicon: simple custom shortcut/tab icon [[link](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/)]
* Google Analytics: track website traffic [[link](https://analytics.google.com)]
* Mobile Friendly: increase readability and accessibility of website by adjusting elements based on screen size
* Social Media Icons: SVG vector-based format icons in footer that link to social media
* Twitter Feed: widget to show the latest tweets from my Twitter account [[link](https://publish.twitter.com/)]
* Sticky Sidebar (`js/sticky_sidebar.js`): quickly navigate between sections using the sidebar on select pages [[code example](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_fixed_sidebar.asp)]
* Scroll to Top Button (`js/scroll_to_top.js`): click on a button to automatically scroll back to the top of the page [[code example](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_scroll_to_top.asp)]
* Dark Mode (`js/dark_mode.js`): toggle between ðŸŒ– light and ðŸŒ’ dark mode versions of the website [[code example](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_toggle_dark_mode.asp)]
* Modal Images (`js/modal.js`): on click, create a pop-up of a zoomed-in version of an image [[code example](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modal_images.asp)]
* GitHub Analytics (`js/github_analytics.js`): plots Javascript charts of GitHub repo analytics data
* Google Scholar Analytics (`js/scholar_analytics.js`): adds citation counts from Google Scholar for publications
