                <p style="text-align:justify" id="mediumspace">I am looking to recruit 1-2 MSc and PhD students to start in the 2026-2027 academic year. The deadlines for the <a id="underline_link_bold" href="https://geog.ubc.ca/graduate/admissions/" target="_blank">MSc and PhD programs</a> at UBC Geography are in mid-December and mid-January, respectively. Interested students should fill out this <a id="underline_link_bold" href="https://forms.gle/MoHjdkseE3BLzXS46" target="_blank">Google Form</a> before they apply. I will then email strong applicants to set up a brief Zoom / Skype chat. Strong applicants will have some experience in coding (e.g., R, Python, Google Earth Engine) and conducting research in environmental science, atmospheric science, geography, applied math, and/or computer science and at least some coursework or training in these topics. Competitive Ph.D. applicants should have completed a MSc and led independent research that is published or moving toward publication in reputable peer-reviewed journals.</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify" id="mediumspace">If you are unable to access the <a id="underline_link_bold" href="https://forms.gle/MoHjdkseE3BLzXS46" target="_blank">Google Form</a>, please <a id="underline_link_bold" href="mailto:tianjia.liu@ubc.ca" target="_blank">email</a> (tianjia.liu [at] ubc.ca) me with [Prospective Student Inquiry] in the email subject line and include the following:</p>
                <p id="nospace">• research level you're interested in (undergraduate, Masters, or PhD)</p>
                <p id="nospace">• CV / resume</p>
                <p id="nospace">• unofficial transcripts</p>
                <p id="mediumspace">• a brief statement on your research interests and why you are interested in this lab</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify" id="nospace">MSc and PhD students in UBC Geography are guaranteed funding through research and teaching assistantships, fellowships, awards, and department funds. I encourage applicants, if eligible, to apply for NSERC graduate fellowships (<a id="underline_link_bold" href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/cgsm-bescm_eng.asp" target="_blank">MSc</a>, <a id="underline_link_bold" href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/bellandpostgrad-belletsuperieures_eng.asp" target="_blank">PhD</a>). I will assist with applications for these programs and other relevant external funding programs. I currently do not have guaranteed funding for postdocs, but I would be happy to assist with applications for <a id="underline_link_bold" href="https://www.postdocs.ubc.ca/awards-funding/funding-opportunities" target="_blank">UBC</a> and <a id="underline_link_bold" href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PD-NP/index_eng.asp" target="_blank">NSERC</a> postdoctoral fellowship programs.</p>
